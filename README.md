# igemnace's dotfiles

## Note

This repo is full of cruft, hard-coding, hacks, and whatnot. I might have been
proud of my dotfiles at some point in time, but as I've grown in learning, I've
come to realize that **none** of what I do here is done elegantly.

I'll be giving as much effort as I can spare to remedy this, but that's not
saying much. It'll take me quite a bit of time to clean this up.

To anyone else reading this, you are free to steal a snippet or two if you like
something; I leave it to your good judgment. **Caveat emptor.**

## Introduction

These are the miscellaneous dotfiles for most of the themed elements in my
desktop (i3, rofi, etc).

My zsh, tmux, and vim configs aren't here. Those configs are much more than just
styling, so they have their own repos. If you want to check them out, see the
following repos:

- [zsh-config](https://github.com/igemnace/zsh-config)
- [tmux-config](https://github.com/igemnace/tmux-config)
- [vim-config](https://github.com/igemnace/vim-config)

I'm also starting out with Emacs. (Update: Heh. 4 months into the future, still
"starting out with Emacs"!)

My Emacs config isn't as rich as the above, but it's still hosted on its own
repo:

- [emacs-config](https://github.com/igemnace/emacs-config)

## Pre-Installation

The dotfiles are for the following programs:

- ALSA with PulseAudio
- cmus
- feh
- GTK 2.0
- GTK 3.0
- i3
- i3bar
- i3lock
- i3status
- light (for brightness)
- rofi
- rxvt-unicode
- Xbindkeys
- Xcape
- Xmodmap
- Xorg

## Installation

There's an `install` script, but I don't recommend it.

Better to just grab bits and pieces, then place in their proper locations
(`cfg/` follows `$HOME` directory structure).

## Licensing

If anyone else sees this and wants to use it, go ahead.
