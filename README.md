# igemnace's dotfiles

These are the miscellaneous dotfiles for most of the themed elements in my
desktop (i3, rofi, etc).

My zsh, tmux, and vim configs aren't here. Those configs are much more than just
styling, so they have their own repos. If you want to check them out, see the
following repos:

- [zsh-config](https://github.com/igemnace/zsh-config)
- [tmux-config](https://github.com/igemnace/tmux-config)
- [vim-config](https://github.com/igemnace/vim-config)

My custom todo.txt helper script also isn't here, since it's not style-related.
If you want to check it out, see the following repo:

## Installation

Right now there is no automated installation method. If you want to use a
dotfile, simply take it from this repo and copy or symlink to the necessary
directories.

Installation scripts are coming soon. This is just a very quick upload, mostly
for posting my setup to [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).
