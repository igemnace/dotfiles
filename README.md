# igemnace's dotfiles

These are the miscellaneous dotfiles for most of the themed elements in my
desktop (i3, rofi, etc).

## Installation

Right now there is no automated installation method. If you want to use a
dotfile, simply take it from this repo and copy or symlink to the necessary
directories.

Installation scripts are coming soon. This is just a very quick upload, mostly
for posting my setup to [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).

## Licensing

If anyone else sees this and wants to use it, go ahead.
